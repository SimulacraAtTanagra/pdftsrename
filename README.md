## The purpose of this project is as follows:
This program converts a PDF-formatted timesheet generated by PR-Assist and renames it based on its contents.
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
In doing an audit, i t is sometimes necessary to review massive amounts of files, such as timesheets. Doing so programatically, using Seleinum for example, can result in many files with the same name. This program allows procedural downloading of PDf formatted data in such a way that the data is still recognizeable without opening the file. 
## This project leverages the following libraries:
pandas, fuzzywuzzy, textract
## This project does not require any special setup steps.

## The expected frequency for running this code is as follows:
